Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present \"Shape\", Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.

Many manga serialized in \"Dengeki Daioh\" were later published in \"tankōbon\" volumes under ASCII Media Works\\' Dengeki Comics imprint. The magazine is sold every month on the 27th. A yonkoma section of \"Dengeki Daioh\" called \"Dengeki Yonkoma Daioh\" (電撃4コマ大王 ) features various omake strips of the manga series published in it. The format is typically a normal drawing on the right side featuring one or sometimes more characters, and a vertical four panel strip on the left featuring characters from the associated series in super deformed form. Two special editions of the magazine called \"Dengeki Moeoh\" and \"Dengeki Daioh Genesis\" are sold bimonthly and quarterly, respectively.'},\n",

The company was merged with ASCII on April 1, 2008, and became ASCII Media Works. They mainly catered to the Japanese male otaku crowd, covering such topics as anime, light novels, manga, plastic modelling, and visual novels. However, MediaWorks had published three magazines targeted towards females—\"Comic Sylph\", \"Dengeki Girl\\'s Style\", and \"Character Parfait\"—but each one was a special edition version of another magazine. MediaWorks ran yearly contests for original novel and manga submissions, such as the light novel Dengeki Novel Prize contest.'}],\n",
